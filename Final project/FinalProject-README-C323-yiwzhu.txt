C323 / Spring 2020

Final Project
Yiwei Zhu, yiwzhu@iu.edu

I did the persistent data storage (originally from NSUserdefaults to CoreData)
for the app. i also did most of the view controllers (other than audio and statistics) 
and make connections between them.

The interesting part is I make all the buttons an image so user can tap on a image 
rather than a boring/plain button.

The questions i have encounter during the development is how to successfully implement 
CoreData and saving user inputs as strings so we can use it later.

WE all did similar amount of work, so the contribution is 33.3333333% foe everyone.
