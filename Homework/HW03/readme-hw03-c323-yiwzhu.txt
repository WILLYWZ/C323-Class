I did plus, minus, divide, multiply, and equals function.

I also did the AC button and the +/- sign, however the +/- button only work for one time and it stop giving responses.

I think I complete the rest of the button, but some of them may not work as it designed to do,( mc, mr, m-, m+).

I tried to make it looking like the iPhone calculator as close as possible.

I think, given more time, I can better do the memory buttons which I am confused about, as I don't use them, and I kind of know nothing of their properties.

I still don't know this:

Why would you need a multiplication and a division in a binary calculator, I mean, do they really serve a need?
