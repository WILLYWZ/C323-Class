In our foraging game, we want to achieve several functionalities, 
we want each player to have the option to make and join private/public rooms 
friends/other players created,walking freely in the room, chat with other 
players in real times, and to send and receive direct messages to/from other players.

The functionalities are important because it is a way of virtual interactions with 
other people, and this app is like providing a platform for users to achieve such goals.

The main prupose of the app is to create a virtual space for people that they can do 
whatever they want. All the functionalities we want to provide are surrounding a single point, 
which is to make everything easier and smoother for the user, which we plan to use some UI designs.
